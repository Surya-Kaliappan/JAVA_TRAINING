# Control Flow Statement

1) IF
2) If-else
3) If-elseIf
4) Nested If
5) Switch case

# User Input
* for user input import Scanner class from java.util
* It has cammelcase (nextInt, nextFloat, ...)
    - nextInt
    - nextFloat
    - nextDoublt

# String
* String is class
* for getting input use 'next' & 'nextLine'
* nextLine needs the Enter key for the input. but 'next' works asusual like getting the input as String
* It has lot of functions like
    - charAt(index) -> it will give the character of the string at particular index.

# Switch
* it works like elif ladder with 'case' keyword.

# Jump Statements
1) break
2) continue

# loops
1) for loop
    - execute the sequection of execution in series.
    - for(;;) will loop infinite.
    - expansion of the while loop is the for loop
2) while loop
3) do-while loop
    - do statement always exists with while
4) foreach loop

# Info
* int + int = int
* int + float = float
* String + anyDataType = String
