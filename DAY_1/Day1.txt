In 1978 - C
	by Dennis Ritchie
DRAWBACKS
1) not good handling memory
2) No exception handling
3) it doesn't follows OOPS paradigm.

In 1979 - C++
	by Bjarne stroustrip
DRAWBACKS
1) Pointers
2) Operator overloading using virtual function.
3) no platform independent.

In 1991 Python

1995 - JAVA programming 
	by james gosling
FEATURES
1) Simple
2) Robust (meaning powerful)
3) Platform Independent (by using JVM)
	- jdk is platform independent
	- jvm is platform dependent
4) It follows OOPS paradigm.
5) Good in memory management
	- garbage collector
6) It is Multi-Threaded Language
7) It handles Exception Handling.
8) Distributed Language
	- for web applications
	- for embedded system
	- for TCP/IP protocals
9) It is protable.

OOPS - Object Oriented Programming
POP - Procedural Oridented Programming

JDK - Java Development Kit 
JRE - Java Realtime Environment
JVM - Java Virtual Machine
JIT - Just In Time interpreter (Double checks the bytecode)

J2SE - JAVA 2 STANDARD EDITION (Core JAVA)
J2EE - JAVA 2 ENTERPRISE EDITION 
J2ME - JAVA 2 MICRO EDITION

JCSD - JAVA CERTIFIED SUN DEVELOPER
JCOD - JAVA CERTIFIED ORACLE DEVELOPER

4 PILLARS for OOPS
1) Encapsulation
2) Polymorphism
3) Inheritance
4) Abstraction

DATATYPES
byte    - 1 byte
short	- 2 bytes
int	- 4 bytes
long	- 8 bytes
float	- 4 bytes
double	- 8 bytes
boolean	- 1 bit
char	- 2 bytes

TYPE CASTING
1) narrow typecasting (reducing the datatype)
2) Widining typecasting (increase the datatype)

OPERATOR
1) Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
2) Relational (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
3) Assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
4) Logical (&&, ||, !)
5) Bitwise (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>)
6) Unary ()
7) Ternary
8) Comma

<< -> N*2pow(n)
>> -> N/2pow(n)
>>> -> N/2pow(n) (positive)

TYPES OF VARIABLE
1) Local Variable
2) Global Variable
3) Static Variable

* IS the java 100% oops? - No
* Simula is considered as the first OOPS language.
* The history of JAVA starts from Green Team. 
* JAVA has named by javabeans in Indonesia.
* Other than '$' and '_' we can't able use any special symbols
* \u denotes unicode. which has all language like english, tamil, etc.

GITHUB SESSION:
-> To initialize the git execute "git init" in the local repo.
